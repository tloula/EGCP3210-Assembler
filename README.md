# Computer Architecture Assembler

First, I designed a virtual microprocessor in a logic simulator. Then, I wrote the assembler program that assembles code to run in my microprocessor's memory. I chose to use Java and the Swing GUI Widget Toolkit. I was awarded extra credit for my user interface design.

To run the assembler, download and run the Assembler.jar file.
The <i>About</i> button shows more detailed instructions on what each button does.
The choose file button opens up a file chooser to select the file,
loads the selected file into the loaded file text area,
and assembles the file all at once.<br />

<i>testFile1.asm</i> and <i>testFile2.asm</i> are provided to test the program. When complete, the assembler will generate <i>memory.txt</i> and <i>symbols.txt</i> files.
